# GitPress

GitPress is a **minimal, Git-backed Markdown CMS**.  
The goal is to let non-technical users create, edit, and publish blog posts stored in a GitHub repository, without ever touching Git directly.

---

## üéØ Scope

- **Self-contained app** that anyone can clone and run.
- **Environment-based configuration**: repo URL, blog directory, credentials.
- **Web-based UI** served on `http://localhost:3333`.
- **Markdown file management**:
  - Explore all `.md` files in the target directory.
  - Read and edit existing posts.
  - Create new posts.
  - Delete posts.
- **Publish action**:
  - Commits all changes.
  - Pushes to the configured Git repository automatically.

That‚Äôs it. No extra complexity, no database, no external services.
